        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
            This site is built entirely by visitors like you. We call your contributions <strong>"Bricks."</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>What is a "Brick"?</h3>
        <p>
            A brick is simply a command you send us to change the website. You don't need to know how to code—just tell us what you want to see.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                🧱 <em>“Add a picture of a squirrel.”</em> — <strong>That’s a brick.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                🧱 <em>“Change the background color to neon pink.”</em> — <strong>That’s a brick.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                🧱 <em>“Write a poem about coffee at the top of the page.”</em> — <strong>That’s a brick.</strong>
            </li>
